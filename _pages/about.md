I am a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College London. My research focuses on combining deep learning with mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning.
I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at Imperial College London.
My thesis investigated the stability and instability of extremal black holes in general relativity.
