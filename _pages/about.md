    This is some example text that will wrap around the image. You can continue writing more content, and it will automatically flow around the image. 
    If the text is long enough, it will extend below the image and continue filling the page normally.

I am a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College London. My research focuses on combining deep learning with mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning.
I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at Imperial College London.
My thesis investigated the stability and instability of extremal black holes in general relativity.
